# Artifact Javascript

Does not Work on Mobile

Tested Mostly on Chrome, Should Also work on FireFox

Cards Not implemented are ignored

Remove the "playartifact.com" from deck codes, they should start with ADC

# Main Menu

Deck: Edit the decklist for your deck. Manually add and remove cards by typing a comma-seperated list of cards (including signature cards) into the text box. The '3 of' toggle will put 3 of every card listed in the box into your deck, allowing above and below maximum deck limits.

Items: Works the same as the Deck section but with the item deck instead of main card deck. 

Heroes: Adding more than 5 heroes is often recomended, with limited hero selection adding only 5 heroes will sometimes not give enough heroes to start the game. Heros are deployed in the order of listing, use the shuffle button to randomize deployment. 

Import: Import a decklist. Deck codes should start with ADC (playartifact.com removed from the code). Cards that are not implemented are ignored. 

Settings: Allows the setting of Tower Handicap, AI Mana Bonus, and AI Gold Bonus. The defaults for these values is 0.

Mono Green Deck/Mono Red Deck: Automatically import a decklist for mono green or mono red. 

For full list of implemented cards, see the Wiki.
